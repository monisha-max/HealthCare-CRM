## Problem Statement
Healthcare facilities often need help with fragmented systems that complicate the management of patient registrations, medical records, scheduling, billing, and more. This disjointed approach leads to inefficiencies, data silos, and a subpar patient experience, making it challenging for both patients and providers to access and manage essential information seamlessly.

## Our Solution
We developed a Java-based healthcare CRM, a comprehensive and intuitive platform engineered with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to transform healthcare management. This all-in-one application consolidated patient and doctor registrations, medical records, diagnoses, insurance details, care plans, reminders, appointment scheduling, billing, feedback, and immunization tracking into a single, easy-to-navigate system.
